# SquishableQuest2024

## To do:
	- cells in cell manager stored in an array to avoid Find() calls
	- fix selection issues (from selected tile, cannot select others)
	- correct sequencing for room exploration (room reveals before destination reached in animation)

## Possible changes
	- move currently allows diagonals with 1 adjacent friend or foe; if this is kept, the Traverse function no longer needs to take CharacterType as an input; 
	however, maybe change this to only allow diagonal with friendlies?
