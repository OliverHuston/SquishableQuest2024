# SquishableQuest2024

To do:
	- fix move distance calculation (disallow diagonal move through blocked corners; blocked corner = no map or enemy; 
		if only 1 ally blocking, then diagonal allowed)
	- fix selection issues (from selected tile, cannot select others)
	- correct sequencing for room exploration (room reveals before destination reached in animation)
